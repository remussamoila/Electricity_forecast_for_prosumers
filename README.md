## 📈 Electricity Consumption Forecast – Project Plan

This project aims to forecast electricity consumption for prosumers using historical consumption, production, and weather data. The following steps outline the full pipeline from data collection to model evaluation.

---

### 1. 🧹 Data Collection & Cleaning
- Load historical consumption and production data (2020–2025).
- Load weather data from all available stations.
- Align timestamps across datasets (downsample or interpolate if necessary).
- Remove or impute missing values (especially in weather data).
- Normalize or standardize relevant features.

---

### 2. 🧠 Feature Engineering
- **Time-based features**: hour, day of week, holiday, season, trend.
- **Weather features**: average temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation.
- **Lag features**: past consumption values (e.g., t-1, t-24, t-168).
- **Rolling window features**: 3h, 24h, 7-day moving averages.
- **Interaction features**: weather × time of day (e.g., temperature × hour).

---

### 3. 🤖 Modeling
- Split data using **time-based validation** (no data leakage).
- Train baseline models (e.g., Linear Regression, SARIMAX).
- Train advanced models:
  - Tree-based models: XGBoost, LightGBM
  - Neural networks: LSTM/GRU for sequential patterns
- Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna or GridSearchCV

---

### 4. 📊 Evaluation
- Use metrics suited for regression:
  - RMSE, MAE, MAPE
- Evaluate models on unseen time windows.
- Visualize:
  - Actual vs predicted plots
  - Feature importance (for tree models)
  - SHAP values (to interpret model behavior)

---

### 5. 🚀 Deployment (optional)
- Save trained model (e.g., with `joblib` or `pickle`).
- Create API endpoint for real-time prediction (e.g., FastAPI).
- Deploy as a demo (e.g., Streamlit dashboard or HuggingFace Space).

### 📌 Final Goal

To build an accurate and interpretable model that forecasts electricity consumption based on historical consumption and weather conditions — aiding energy planning and smart grid behavior for prosumers.
